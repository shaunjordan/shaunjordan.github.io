<p class="text-left">Hello! I'm Shaun Jordan. <br>
  <br>
I'm an amateur web developer with a passion for learning new things. <br>
My page will be devoted to documenting whatever projects I'm working on, <br>
mostly in the realm of JS, but I'll also venture into other elements. <br>
<br>
This page is a work in progress, so stay tuned for updates!
<br>
<br>
Follow along on my <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>. <br>
or reach out to me via the <a href="/contact/index.html">contacts</a> page.
