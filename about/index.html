  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>Hello! I'm Shaun Jordan, an aspiring developer and writer based in Springfield, Missouri. I am currently working on a degree in Software Development. I've been building and playing with computers since I was 13, but I came to the party late in terms of programming. It wasn't until I wrote an Excel macro, of all things, that a spark was lit and I discovered my passion had always been at the tip of my fingers.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Things I Practice</h4>
  <ul class="practice">
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>HTML5/CSS3</li>
    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>Excel/VBA</li>
    <li>C#</li>
  </ul>
