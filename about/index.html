  <h4>About Me</h4>
  <p>Hello! I'm Shaun Jordan and I like to make things, be it digital or analog. I built my first computer with my grandpa at 13 and haven't looked back. I'm currently working toward a degree in Software Development. I try to use my skills to make my life, and the life of those around me, just a little bit easier.</p>

  <h4>Things I Practice</h4>

    <li>SQL</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Excel/VBA/M</li>
  </ul>
