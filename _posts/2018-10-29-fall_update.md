Writing an entry for a blog no one is yet reading is a daunting task, especially after days spent studying and working on other side projects. Originally intended to be an outlet for writing practice and thought collection, the blog turned into a dusty little thing hidden in a corner somewhere - such is the fate of many blogs. Frankly, this probably won't change until I'm out of school next year. If you've found yourself here somehow, welcome. And if you're interested in what I'm up to, read on for a bit. 

It's been a rather busy last few months since my previous post. I'm on a clear, steady path to completing school next year. The associated exhaustion is worth it. Every project or test knocked out feels like a genuine accomplishment. My development track has focused on C#, which I enjoy enough to know I want to learn more and get better. Not too long ago, I was searching for a better way to redo the Knowledge Quest app, and I think building it in Unity might be something to look into. It works for now, but it could be so much better.

I've also been mulling over my final project and it appears Olga might have a good challenge. The program she uses to track metrics has two components that need to talk to each other, but don't, requiring her to fill in the same data in multiple places. A "going around your elbow to get to your thumb" kind of thing. I think I can write the necessary proposal to correct this and improve the functionality - at least that's my idea so far.

Outside of tech-related stuff, I decided to build a desk over the summer due to not finding one that fit my specifications exactly. It turned out great. Plenty of room to hold my two monitors which some extra in case I hook up another, or set a Pi off to the side (as I plan to do for some Christmas light project I have in mind). School takes up the majority of my time, so if you know me personally, haven't seen me in a while and, most importantly, would like to, give me a shout. My free time is coming back soon and we should grab some lunch.

That's all for now. Take care.
